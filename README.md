# Angular Schematics Utilities

A comprehensive set of utilities to build Angular schematics.

**Important**: This repository contains some of the utilities used in the `@schematics/angular` package. Credits to the Angular team. The original utilites can be found here: https://github.com/angular/devkit/tree/master/packages/schematics/angular/utility. 

I'm creating this package because I found these utilities to be very useful when building schematics, but unfortunately they're not exposed in the devkit package. I'll enrich this library by adding more utilities to the public API.

## Installation

`npm install ng-schematics-utils`
